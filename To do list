1. Offline detection of changepoints to check our model's accuracy
2. Find real time data and/or other datasets that would be interesting to present
3. Extend the algorithm for other distributions (Poisson etc.)
4. How to find the optimal lambda value from data
5. Look at higher dimensional data for possibility to use with multivariate gaussion distribution (maybe different stock indicators
could be a possible dataset to test)
6. Start building up ideas on what to present
